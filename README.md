# Text Toxicity Prediction

This is a Python project that uses machine learning to predict whether a given text is toxic or not. We use the `LinearSVC` classifier from `scikit-learn`, trained on a dataset of pre-labeled comments.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/chandutony97/HateSpeech.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run `python Three.py` and follow the prompts to input a sentence. The script will return whether the sentence is predicted as toxic or non-toxic.

## Project Structure

- `Three.py`: This is the main script, which runs the model and interacts with the user.
- `train.csv`: The training data for the model.
- `test.csv`: The test data for the model.
